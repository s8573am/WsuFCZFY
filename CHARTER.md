# AWS Copilot CLI Charter

## Mission
Our mission is to help customers build, release and operate applications on Amazon ECS with DevOps best practices and production ready infrastructure patterns.

## Tenets (unless you know better ones) ðŸŒŸ
* **Users think in terms of architecture, not of infrastructure.**
Developers creating a new microservice shouldn't have to specify VPCs, load balancer settings, or complex pipeline configuration.
They may not know anything about other AWS services. They should be able to specify what "kind" of application it is and how
it fits into their overall architecture; the infrastructure should be generated from that.
* **Create modern applications by default.**
Modern applications can consist of one or more services, jobs, and supporting resources like databases. 
Copilot ensures that all parts of an application are wired together securely and sensibly.
* **Deliver applications continuously.**
While the AWS Copilot CLI can be used to manually deploy changes to an application, we always help customers to move to CI/CD by helping them set up and manage pipelines.
* **Operations is part of the workflow.**
Modeling, provisioning, and deploying applications are only part of the application lifecycle for the developer.
The CLI must support workflows around troubleshooting and debugging to help when things go wrong.
