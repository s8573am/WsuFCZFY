## 15 Common Pandas Polars SQL PySpark Translations
Slide 1: Introduction to Data Processing Libraries

Data processing is a crucial aspect of modern data science and analytics. This slideshow will explore the relationships and translations between four popular data processing libraries: Pandas, Polars, SQL, and PySpark. We'll discuss their strengths, use cases, and how to translate common operations between them.

Slide 2: Pandas Overview

Pandas is a widely-used Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow for efficient handling of structured data. Pandas is known for its ease of use and rich functionality.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris']
})

print(df)
```

Slide 3: Polars Introduction

Polars is a modern, high-performance data manipulation library written in Rust with Python bindings. It aims to address some of Pandas' limitations by offering multi-core computation, lazy execution, and efficient memory usage.

```python
import polars as pl

# Create a DataFrame
df = pl.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris']
})

print(df)
```

Slide 4: SQL Basics

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It's widely used for data analysis and retrieval in various database systems.

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    City VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO employees (Name, Age, City)
VALUES ('Alice', 25, 'New York'),
       ('Bob', 30, 'London'),
       ('Charlie', 35, 'Paris');

-- Query data
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Slide 5: PySpark Introduction

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework designed for big data processing. It allows for efficient analysis and processing of large-scale datasets across multiple nodes in a cluster.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Example").getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("Alice", 25, "New York"),
    ("Bob", 30, "London"),
    ("Charlie", 35, "Paris")
], ["Name", "Age", "City"])

df.show()
```

Slide 6: Data Selection

Selecting specific columns is a common operation across all four libraries. Here's how it's done in each:

```python
# Pandas
pandas_result = df[['Name', 'Age']]

# Polars
polars_result = df.select(['Name', 'Age'])

# SQL
sql_query = "SELECT Name, Age FROM employees"

# PySpark
pyspark_result = df.select('Name', 'Age')
```

Slide 7: Filtering Data

Filtering data based on conditions is another essential operation. Let's compare the syntax:

```python
# Pandas
pandas_result = df[df['Age'] > 30]

# Polars
polars_result = df.filter(pl.col('Age') > 30)

# SQL
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE Age > 30"

# PySpark
pyspark_result = df.filter(df['Age'] > 30)
```

Slide 8: Aggregation

Aggregating data to compute summary statistics is a common task in data analysis. Here's how it's done across the libraries:

```python
# Pandas
pandas_result = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()

# Polars
polars_result = df.groupby('City').agg(pl.col('Age').mean())

# SQL
sql_query = "SELECT City, AVG(Age) FROM employees GROUP BY City"

# PySpark
pyspark_result = df.groupBy('City').avg('Age')
```

Slide 9: Joining Data

Combining data from multiple sources through joins is a fundamental operation in data processing. Let's see how it's done:

```python
# Assuming we have two DataFrames: df1 and df2 with a common 'ID' column

# Pandas
pandas_result = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID')

# Polars
polars_result = df1.join(df2, on='ID')

# SQL
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.ID = table2.ID"

# PySpark
pyspark_result = df1.join(df2, 'ID')
```

Slide 10: Handling Missing Data

Dealing with missing values is crucial in data preprocessing. Here's how each library approaches it:

```python
# Pandas
pandas_result = df.dropna()  # Drop rows with any missing values
pandas_result = df.fillna(0)  # Fill missing values with 0

# Polars
polars_result = df.drop_nulls()
polars_result = df.fill_null(0)

# SQL
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL"
sql_query = "SELECT COALESCE(column_name, 0) FROM employees"

# PySpark
pyspark_result = df.dropna()
pyspark_result = df.fillna(0)
```

Slide 11: Date and Time Operations

Working with date and time data is common in many applications. Let's compare date operations:

```python
# Pandas
pandas_result = df['Date'].dt.year

# Polars
polars_result = df.select(pl.col('Date').dt.year())

# SQL
sql_query = "SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) FROM employees"

# PySpark
from pyspark.sql.functions import year
pyspark_result = df.select(year(df['Date']))
```

Slide 12: Window Functions

Window functions allow for calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Here's how they're implemented:

```python
# Pandas
pandas_result = df.groupby('City')['Age'].transform('mean')

# Polars
polars_result = df.select(pl.col('Age').mean().over('City'))

# SQL
sql_query = """
SELECT *, AVG(Age) OVER (PARTITION BY City) AS avg_age
FROM employees
"""

# PySpark
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg
window_spec = Window.partitionBy('City')
pyspark_result = df.withColumn('avg_age', avg('Age').over(window_spec))
```

Slide 13: Performance Considerations

When choosing between these libraries, consider factors like dataset size, computation requirements, and system resources. Pandas is great for smaller datasets and ease of use. Polars excels in performance for medium to large datasets. SQL is ideal for relational database operations. PySpark is best for distributed processing of very large datasets.

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Weather Data Analysis

Let's analyze weather data across different cities:

```python
# Sample data (replace with actual data loading)
weather_data = {
    'City': ['Tokyo', 'New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Sydney'],
    'Temperature': [25, 22, 18, 20, 28],
    'Humidity': [60, 55, 70, 65, 50],
    'Wind_Speed': [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
}

# Pandas
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(weather_data)
avg_temp = df.groupby('City')['Temperature'].mean()
print("Average Temperature by City:")
print(avg_temp)

# Polars
import polars as pl
df = pl.DataFrame(weather_data)
avg_temp = df.groupby('City').agg(pl.col('Temperature').mean())
print("Average Temperature by City:")
print(avg_temp)

# SQL (using SQLite for demonstration)
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
df.to_sql('weather', conn, index=False)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT City, AVG(Temperature) FROM weather GROUP BY City")
print("Average Temperature by City:")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(f"{row[0]}: {row[1]}")

# PySpark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("WeatherAnalysis").getOrCreate()
df = spark.createDataFrame(weather_data)
avg_temp = df.groupBy('City').avg('Temperature')
print("Average Temperature by City:")
avg_temp.show()
```
